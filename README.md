# Heart Attack Analysis in India

## Overview
This project analyzes heart attack data in India using Jupyter Notebook. The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning models to understand risk factors and predict heart attacks.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature selection, and data normalization.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Training and evaluating predictive models.
- **Commented Code:** Each section of the notebook includes comments explaining the purpose and logic of the code.

## File Structure
- **Heart_Attack_India.ipynb** - The main Jupyter Notebook containing code, analysis, and visualizations.
- **data/** - (If applicable) Contains datasets used for analysis.
- **README.md** - Project documentation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Heart_Attack_India.git
   cd Heart_Attack_India
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
